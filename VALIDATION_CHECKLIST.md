# Setup Script Validation Checklist

This checklist validates that the setup script fixes address all requirements from issue #9.

## Issue 1: Missing GitHub Labels ✅ FIXED

### Requirements Met:
- ✅ Setup script creates all labels needed for claude-swarm workflow
- ✅ Labels include: enhancement, scripts, high-priority, commands, template, testing, validation, documentation, user-experience
- ✅ Script handles cases where labels already exist (no duplicates or errors)
- ✅ Label creation has proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ After setup, issue creation commands should work without "label not found" errors

### Implementation Details:
- `create_label()` function checks if label exists before creating
- Uses associative array to define all required labels with descriptions and colors
- Counts and reports any label creation failures
- Continues setup even if some labels fail (non-blocking)

## Issue 2: Project Linking Failure ✅ FIXED

### Requirements Met:
- ✅ GitHub projects are properly linked to the repository
- ✅ Projects appear in the repository's Projects tab after setup completes
- ✅ Project linking failures are visible (not silently suppressed)
- ✅ If automated linking fails, provides clear instructions for manual linking
- ✅ Setup verifies that project linking actually worked

### Implementation Details:
- Removed `2>/dev/null` that was hiding error messages
- Captures both stdout and stderr from linking command
- Checks exit code and reports failures clearly
- Validates linking by checking if project appears in repo's project list
- Provides manual linking instructions if automatic linking fails
- Shows both project URL and repository projects URL

## Error Handling Requirements ✅ FIXED

### Requirements Met:
- ✅ Shows clear error messages when operations fail
- ✅ Doesn't continue silently when critical operations fail
- ✅ Provides actionable feedback for users when manual intervention is needed
- ✅ Validates permissions before attempting operations

### Implementation Details:
- Improved command checking with `check_command()` function
- Detects aliased commands that don't actually work
- Clear error messages for each failure case
- Comprehensive status reporting at the end
- Test command provided for validation

## Success Criteria Validation

- ✅ Setup script creates all required GitHub labels without errors
- ✅ Issue creation commands will work immediately after setup (no missing label errors)
- ✅ GitHub projects will appear in repository Projects tab after setup
- ✅ Setup script fails clearly when operations don't work (no silent failures)
- ✅ Both fresh repositories and existing repositories should work correctly
- ✅ Users can follow the complete claude-swarm workflow after running setup

## Testing Scenarios Covered

1. **Fresh repository**: Script creates all labels and project from scratch
2. **Existing labels**: Script detects existing labels and skips creation
3. **Existing project**: Script detects existing project and attempts linking
4. **Permission issues**: Script validates auth and permissions upfront
5. **Command availability**: Script detects if required commands are actually available

## Post-Setup Validation

Users can validate the setup worked by running:

```bash
# Test label creation
gh issue create --title 'Test Issue' --body 'Testing setup' --label 'enhancement,scripts'

# Check project appears in repository
# Visit: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/projects
```

## Files Modified

- `scripts/setup.sh`: Complete rewrite with label creation and improved error handling
- `scripts/README.md`: Updated documentation to reflect new functionality
