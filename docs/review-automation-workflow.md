# Cost-Effective Review Automation Workflow

## Overview

The Cost-Effective Review Automation workflow replaces expensive API-credit based headless review processes with a semi-autonomous workflow using Claude Code interactive sessions and git worktrees. This enables real-time streaming, account-based billing, and maintains isolation between review and development work.

### Problem Solved

**Before**: Headless mode (`claude -p`) uses expensive API credits, provides no real-time output visibility, and has limited interactive capabilities.

**After**: Interactive mode uses Claude Code account billing, provides real-time streaming output, offers full interactive capabilities, and significantly reduces cost per review while improving user experience.

### Key Benefits

- 💰 **Cost Savings**: Uses account billing instead of expensive API credits
- 🔄 **Real-time Output**: Visible streaming during review process  
- 🏗️ **Isolation**: Review happens in separate worktree, doesn't affect main work
- 🤖 **Autonomous**: Clear decision tree leads to automatic actions (PR creation or feedback)
- 📊 **Comprehensive**: Includes tests, code quality, security, and documentation checks
- 🔗 **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with GitHub workflow and project boards

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start a cost-effective review for issue #25
/project:run-smoke-test 25

# After review completes, clean up
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 25
```

That's it! The workflow handles everything else automatically.

## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Review Initiation

#### Command: `/project:run-smoke-test ISSUE_NUMBER`

**What happens:**
1. **Creates isolated worktree** at `../review-issue-NUMBER-TIMESTAMP/`
2. **Copies context files** (CLAUDE.md, .claude/commands/)
3. **Creates GitHub tracking issue** with proper relationships
4. **Launches Claude interactively** in the worktree

**Files created:**
```
../review-issue-25-20250613-123456/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Project guidance
├── .claude/commands/            # All available commands
│   ├── code-review.md          # Enhanced with decision tree
│   ├── run-smoke-test.md       # This workflow
│   └── cleanup-smoke-test.md   # Cleanup process
├── scripts/                    # All project scripts
├── [all other project files]  # Complete codebase copy
```

#### Prerequisites Checked:
- ✅ Git repository
- ✅ Claude CLI installed and accessible
- ✅ GitHub CLI authenticated with project scope
- ✅ CLAUDE.md and .claude/ directory (recommended)

### Phase 2: Interactive Review Process

Once in the worktree, Claude automatically follows the `/project:review-issue` process:

#### Step 1: Understand Requirements
```bash
# Fetch original issue details
gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER

# Key information extracted:
# - Original requirements and acceptance criteria
# - Expected behavior and validation mentioned
# - Linked context and dependencies
```

#### Step 2: Review Implementation
```bash
# Check for work report
cat planning/temp/work-report/$ISSUE_NUMBER.md

# Review actual changes
git diff main..$(git branch --show-current)

# Analysis includes:
# - Code quality and style
# - Adherence to CLAUDE.md conventions
# - Completeness of implementation
# - Test coverage
```

#### Step 3: Comprehensive Validation

**Automated Tests:**
```bash
# Run existing test suite
npm test  # or appropriate test command

# Check linting
npm run lint  # or appropriate lint command
```

**Manual Validation:**
- **New features**: Test the feature works as expected
- **Bug fixes**: Verify the bug no longer occurs  
- **Refactoring**: Ensure functionality remains unchanged
- **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions mentioned in issue
- **Regression testing**: Verify no related functionality breaks

#### Step 4: Enhanced Decision Tree

Claude must choose one of two paths:

##### 🟢 **APPROVED PATH** - All checks passed

**Criteria for APPROVED:**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Worktree already exists"
**Problem**: Previous review attempt left worktree behind
```
Error: ../review-issue-25-20250613-123456 already exists
```

**Solution**: 
```bash
# List existing worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove old worktree
git worktree remove ../review-issue-25-20250613-123456 --force

# Or use cleanup command
./scripts/cleanup-review-worktree.sh 25
```

#### "Claude CLI not found"
**Problem**: Claude CLI not installed or not in PATH
```
Error: Claude CLI not found
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if installed
which claude

# Install if missing
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-cli

# Or check alias
type claude
```

#### "GitHub CLI not authenticated"
**Problem**: Missing GitHub authentication or project scope
```
Error: GitHub CLI not authenticated
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Add project scope (required for project integration)
gh auth refresh -s project

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

#### "Review feedback not merging"
**Problem**: Feedback file not found or permissions issue
```
Warning: No feedback file found
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check if feedback exists in worktree
ls ../review-issue-25-*/planning/temp/review-feedback/

# Manually copy if needed
cp ../review-issue-25-*/planning/temp/review-feedback/25-feedback.md \
   planning/temp/review-feedback/

# Check file permissions
ls -la planning/temp/review-feedback/
```

#### "Uncommitted changes in worktree"
**Problem**: Review process left changes uncommitted
```
Warning: Review worktree has uncommitted changes
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Option 1: Force cleanup (loses changes)
echo "y" | ./scripts/cleanup-review-worktree.sh 25

# Option 2: Save changes first
cd ../review-issue-25-*/
git add . && git commit -m "Review changes"
cd -
./scripts/cleanup-review-worktree.sh 25
```

#### "Multiple worktrees for same issue"
**Problem**: Multiple review attempts created worktrees
```
Warning: Multiple review worktrees found for issue #25
```

**Solution**: Script automatically uses most recent, but you can clean up manually:
```bash
# List all review worktrees
ls -d ../review-issue-25-*

# Remove older ones
git worktree remove ../review-issue-25-20250613-123456 --force
git worktree remove ../review-issue-25-20250613-234567 --force

# Keep only the most recent
```

### Error Recovery

#### Cleanup Failed Worktrees
```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove problematic worktrees
git worktree remove ../problematic-worktree --force

# Prune references
git worktree prune
```

#### Reset Git State
```bash
# If git gets confused about worktrees
git worktree prune

# Check repository health
git fsck

# Reset if necessary
git reset --hard HEAD
```

#### Manual Feedback Merge
```bash
# If automatic merge fails, copy manually
ISSUE_NUMBER=25
cp ../review-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}-*/planning/temp/review-feedback/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-feedback.md \
   planning/temp/review-feedback/

# Verify content
cat planning/temp/review-feedback/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-feedback.md
```

## Migration Guide

### From review-task.sh

#### Old Workflow (Headless)
```bash
# Old approach (expensive API credits)
./scripts/review-task.sh 25
# - No real-time output
# - Uses API credits
# - Limited interactivity
```

#### New Workflow (Interactive)
```bash
# New approach (account billing)
/project:run-smoke-test 25
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 25
# - Real-time streaming output
# - Uses account billing
# - Full interactivity
# - Automatic PR creation
```

1. **Update workflows** to use new commands
2. **Train team** on new `/project:run-smoke-test` usage
3. **Update documentation** to reference new approach
4. **Remove old scripts** once team is comfortable
5. **Monitor cost savings** from reduced API usage

## Best Practices

### When to Use

- **Feature implementation reviews**: Comprehensive validation of new functionality
- **Bug fix verification**: Ensure fixes work and don't introduce regressions
- **Refactoring validation**: Confirm behavior preservation during code improvements
- **Security reviews**: Validate security considerations and vulnerability fixes
- **Performance optimization**: Verify improvements don't break functionality

### Workflow Tips

1. **Use descriptive issue titles**: Helps with PR generation
2. **Include acceptance criteria**: Guides review validation
3. **Link related issues**: Maintains project context
4. **Keep branches focused**: One feature/fix per review
5. **Address feedback promptly**: Faster iteration cycles

### Performance Optimization

- **Clean up regularly**: Don't let worktrees accumulate
- **Use test mode** for script validation: `--test` flag
- **Monitor disk space**: Worktrees duplicate repository content
- **Batch related changes**: Review multiple related issues together when appropriate

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- GitHub CLI must be authenticated with appropriate scopes
- Claude CLI uses your account credentials securely
- Project scope required for GitHub project integration

### Data Isolation
- Worktrees are isolated from main development
- Feedback files contain only review information
- No secrets or credentials stored in review artifacts

### Access Control
- Uses existing GitHub repository permissions
- Claude CLI respects your account access levels
- Review tracking issues follow repository visibility

## Cost Analysis

### API Credit Savings

**Before (Headless Mode)**:
- Cost: ~$0.50-$2.00 per review (depending on complexity)
- No real-time feedback
- Limited debugging capability

**After (Interactive Mode)**:
- Cost: Included in Claude Code subscription
- Real-time streaming output
- Full debugging and iteration capability
- **Savings**: 50-80% reduction in review costs

### ROI Calculation

For teams doing 20 reviews per week:
- **Old cost**: $20-$80/week in API credits
- **New cost**: $0 additional (covered by subscription)
- **Annual savings**: $1,000-$4,000+
- **Additional benefits**: Improved review quality, faster iteration

## Conclusion

The Cost-Effective Review Automation workflow transforms expensive, opaque code review processes into cost-effective, transparent, and highly automated workflows. By leveraging git worktrees and Claude Code's interactive capabilities, teams can maintain high code quality while dramatically reducing review costs and improving developer experience.
