# Claude Agent Swarm: Review Layer Documentation

## Overview

This system enables **two-layer agent swarm architecture** for software development using GitHub Projects and git worktrees. Implementation agents work on tasks in parallel, then separate review agents evaluate their work with fresh perspective before creating PRs.

### The Two-Layer Agent Architecture

**Layer 1: Implementation Agents**
- Multiple agents work simultaneously on different GitHub issues
- Each agent works in isolated worktree: `../work-issue-NUMBER-timestamp/`
- Agents implement features, fix bugs, or complete assigned tasks
- Work happens in parallel without agent interference

**Layer 2: Review Agents (Smoke Test Layer)**  
- **Fresh agents** review completed work with clean context
- Each review agent works in separate worktree: `../review-issue-NUMBER-timestamp/`
- **Critical isolation**: Review agents have no implementation context
- Objective evaluation leads to APPROVED (auto-PR) or NEEDS_WORK (feedback)

### Problem Solved: Agent Context Contamination

**The Inception Problem**: If the same agent that implemented code also reviews it:
- **Implementation bias**: Agent remembers their reasoning and assumptions
- **Context contamination**: Can't objectively evaluate their own work
- **Missing issues**: Blind to problems they inadvertently created

**The Fresh Review Solution**: Separate review agents with isolated context:
- **Clean perspective**: No knowledge of implementation decisions
- **Objective evaluation**: Reviews code as written, not as intended
- **Fresh eyes**: Catches issues the implementation agent missed

### Key Benefits

- üîÑ **Two-Layer Architecture**: Implementation agents + independent review agents
- üß† **Fresh Perspective**: Review agents have no implementation bias or context contamination
- üèóÔ∏è **Complete Isolation**: Each agent works in separate worktree with clean context
- ü§ñ **Autonomous Decisions**: Review agents auto-create PRs or generate structured feedback
- üéØ **GitHub Projects Integration**: Works with standard software development workflow
- üìä **Objective Quality Control**: Fresh agents catch issues implementation agents miss

## Quick Start: Review Layer Commands

```bash
# After implementation work is complete, start fresh review
/project:run-smoke-test 25

# After review completes, merge feedback and clean up
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 25
```

**Key Point**: These commands manage the **review layer** - fresh agents that objectively evaluate completed implementation work.

## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Fresh Review Agent Initiation

#### Command: `/project:run-smoke-test ISSUE_NUMBER`

**Purpose**: Launch a **fresh review agent** with clean context to objectively evaluate completed implementation work.

**What happens:**
1. **Creates isolated review worktree** at `../review-issue-NUMBER-TIMESTAMP/`
2. **Copies clean context files** (CLAUDE.md, .claude/commands/) - NO implementation context
3. **Creates GitHub tracking issue** linking review to original implementation issue
4. **Launches fresh Claude agent** in isolated environment with zero implementation bias

**Review Worktree Structure:**
```
../review-issue-25-20250613-123456/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                    # Clean project guidance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/commands/            # Review commands available
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code-review.md          # Enhanced decision tree logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run-smoke-test.md       # This workflow documentation  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cleanup-smoke-test.md   # Cleanup process
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                    # All project scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [complete codebase copy]    # Implementation work to review
```

**Critical Isolation Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Fresh conversation context** - No implementation agent history
- ‚úÖ **Clean file state** - No knowledge of implementation process
- ‚úÖ **Objective perspective** - Evaluates work as written, not as intended
- ‚úÖ **Complete codebase** - Can review implementation in full context

#### Prerequisites Automatically Checked:
- ‚úÖ Git repository with implementation work
- ‚úÖ Claude CLI accessible for fresh agent launch
- ‚úÖ GitHub CLI authenticated for issue tracking
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md and .claude/ for consistent agent behavior

### Phase 2: Fresh Agent Review Process

The **fresh review agent** (with zero implementation bias) follows the enhanced `/project:review-issue` process:

#### Step 1: Fresh Requirements Understanding
```bash
# Review agent discovers original requirements with clean eyes
gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER

# Fresh perspective extracts:
# - What was supposed to be implemented
# - Acceptance criteria and success metrics
# - Expected behavior from user perspective
# - NO KNOWLEDGE of implementation decisions or challenges
```

#### Step 2: Objective Implementation Analysis
```bash
# Review agent evaluates what was actually delivered
cat planning/temp/work-report/$ISSUE_NUMBER.md  # If exists

# Analyze changes without implementation bias
git diff main..$(git branch --show-current)

# Fresh evaluation focuses on:
# - Does implementation match requirements?
# - Code quality from external perspective
# - Are there obvious issues missed?
# - Completeness against original spec
```

#### Step 3: Comprehensive Validation

**Automated Tests:**
```bash
# Run existing test suite
npm test  # or appropriate test command

# Check linting
npm run lint  # or appropriate lint command
```

**Manual Validation:**
- **New features**: Test the feature works as expected
- **Bug fixes**: Verify the bug no longer occurs  
- **Refactoring**: Ensure functionality remains unchanged
- **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions mentioned in issue
- **Regression testing**: Verify no related functionality breaks

#### Step 4: Enhanced Decision Tree

Claude must choose one of two paths:

##### üü¢ **APPROVED PATH** - All checks passed

**Criteria for APPROVED:**
- ‚úÖ All automated tests pass
- ‚úÖ Manual smoke tests successful
- ‚úÖ Code quality meets standards
- ‚úÖ No security concerns
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated appropriately
- ‚úÖ All requirements satisfied

**Actions taken:**
1. **Final validation**: Run tests one more time
2. **Create PR immediately**: 
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --title "feat(scope): [description] (#$ISSUE_NUMBER)" \
     --body "## Summary
   
   Implements #$ISSUE_NUMBER - [brief description]
   
   ## Changes Made
   - [specific changes]
   
   ## Testing Completed
   - ‚úÖ All automated tests pass

   Closes #$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
     --assignee @me \
     --label "enhancement" \
     --project "claude-swarm"
   ```
3. **Report success**: Provide PR URL

##### üî¥ **NEEDS_WORK PATH** - Issues found

**Criteria for NEEDS_WORK:**
- ‚ùå Tests failing
- ‚ùå Bugs discovered during testing
- ‚ùå Code quality issues
- ‚ùå Security vulnerabilities

   ## Validation Steps to Retry After Fixes
   1. [specific test to verify fix]
   2. [command to verify fix]
   
   Status: **NEEDS_WORK**
   ```

### Phase 3: Review Completion

#### Command: `/project:cleanup-smoke-test ISSUE_NUMBER`

**What happens:**
1. **Finds review worktree** by pattern matching
2. **Checks for feedback document** in multiple locations
3. **Merges feedback** to original branch (if exists)
4. **Safely removes worktree** with change warnings
5. **Provides next steps** based on review outcome

#### APPROVED Cleanup Flow:
```
No feedback file found
    ‚Üì
Clean worktree removal
    ‚Üì
Report: PR ready for merge
```

**Output:**
```
‚úÖ Review status: APPROVED (no feedback file found)
‚úÖ Review worktree cleaned up
‚úÖ Git worktree references pruned

Next steps for APPROVED:
  1. Merge PR for issue #25
  2. Close review tracking issue
```

#### NEEDS_WORK Cleanup Flow:
```

```

**Output:**
```
‚úÖ Feedback merged to: planning/temp/review-feedback/25-feedback.md
‚ö† Review status: NEEDS_WORK (check feedback for required actions)
‚úÖ Review worktree cleaned up

Next steps for NEEDS_WORK:
  1. Review feedback: cat planning/temp/review-feedback/25-feedback.md
  2. Address identified issues
  3. Re-run review: /run-smoke-test 25
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Parallel Reviews

```bash
# Start multiple reviews simultaneously
/project:run-smoke-test 42  # Authentication feature
/project:run-smoke-test 43  # Database optimization  
/project:run-smoke-test 44  # UI component updates

# Each agent works in isolation:
# Agent 1: Reviews auth in ../review-issue-42-timestamp/
# Agent 2: Reviews DB in ../review-issue-43-timestamp/
# Agent 3: Reviews UI in ../review-issue-44-timestamp/

# No interference between agents!

# Clean up when done
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 42
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 43  
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 44
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix Requiring Changes

```bash
# Start review for bug fix
/project:run-smoke-test 18

# Claude identifies issues:
# ‚ùå Original bug not fully fixed
# ‚ùå Missing test for edge case
# ‚ùå Performance regression introduced

# Result: Detailed feedback created

# Clean up and get feedback
/cleanup-smoke-test 18
# Output: "Feedback merged to planning/temp/review-feedback/18-feedback.md"

# Address feedback
cat planning/temp/review-feedback/18-feedback.md
# Fix the issues...

# Re-review
/project:run-smoke-test 18
# This time: ‚úÖ APPROVED
```

### Example 3: Multiple Review Iterations

```bash
# First attempt
/project:run-smoke-test 67
/cleanup-smoke-test 67  # NEEDS_WORK

# Address feedback, second attempt  
/project:run-smoke-test 67
/cleanup-smoke-test 67  # NEEDS_WORK

# Address remaining issues, final attempt
/project:run-smoke-test 67
/cleanup-smoke-test 67  # APPROVED ‚úÖ

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Worktree already exists"
**Problem**: Previous review attempt left worktree behind
```
Error: ../review-issue-25-20250613-123456 already exists
```

**Solution**: 
```bash
# List existing worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove old worktree
git worktree remove ../review-issue-25-20250613-123456 --force

# Or use cleanup command
./scripts/cleanup-review-worktree.sh 25
```

#### "Claude CLI not found"
**Problem**: Claude CLI not installed or not in PATH
```
Error: Claude CLI not found
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if installed
which claude

# Install if missing
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-cli

# Or check alias
type claude
```

#### "GitHub CLI not authenticated"
**Problem**: Missing GitHub authentication or project scope
```
Error: GitHub CLI not authenticated
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Add project scope (required for project integration)
gh auth refresh -s project

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

#### "Review feedback not merging"
**Problem**: Feedback file not found or permissions issue
```
Warning: No feedback file found
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check if feedback exists in worktree
ls ../review-issue-25-*/planning/temp/review-feedback/

# Manually copy if needed
cp ../review-issue-25-*/planning/temp/review-feedback/25-feedback.md \
   planning/temp/review-feedback/

# Check file permissions
ls -la planning/temp/review-feedback/
```

#### "Uncommitted changes in worktree"
**Problem**: Review process left changes uncommitted
```
Warning: Review worktree has uncommitted changes
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Option 1: Force cleanup (loses changes)
echo "y" | ./scripts/cleanup-review-worktree.sh 25

# Option 2: Save changes first
cd ../review-issue-25-*/
git add . && git commit -m "Review changes"
cd -
./scripts/cleanup-review-worktree.sh 25
```

#### "Multiple worktrees for same issue"
**Problem**: Multiple review attempts created worktrees
```
Warning: Multiple review worktrees found for issue #25
```

**Solution**: Script automatically uses most recent, but you can clean up manually:
```bash
# List all review worktrees
ls -d ../review-issue-25-*

# Remove older ones
git worktree remove ../review-issue-25-20250613-123456 --force
git worktree remove ../review-issue-25-20250613-234567 --force

# Keep only the most recent
```

### Error Recovery

#### Cleanup Failed Worktrees
```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove problematic worktrees
git worktree remove ../problematic-worktree --force

# Prune references
git worktree prune
```

#### Reset Git State
```bash
# If git gets confused about worktrees
git worktree prune

# Check repository health
git fsck

# Reset if necessary
git reset --hard HEAD
```

#### Manual Feedback Merge
```bash
# If automatic merge fails, copy manually
ISSUE_NUMBER=25
cp ../review-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}-*/planning/temp/review-feedback/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-feedback.md \
   planning/temp/review-feedback/

# Verify content
cat planning/temp/review-feedback/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-feedback.md
```

## Migration Guide

### From review-task.sh

#### Old Workflow (Single Agent)
```bash
# Old approach (sequential, blocking)
./scripts/review-task.sh 25
# - Only one review at a time
# - Context mixing issues
# - Manual worktree management
```

#### New Workflow (Agent Swarm)
```bash
# New approach (parallel, isolated)
/project:run-smoke-test 25
/project:run-smoke-test 26  # Can run simultaneously!
/project:run-smoke-test 27  # No interference!

# Clean up when done
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 25
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 26
/project:cleanup-smoke-test 27
```

### Command Comparison

| Old Command | New Command | Benefits |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `./scripts/review-task.sh 25` | `/project:run-smoke-test 25` | Parallel execution, isolation, simplicity |
| Manual cleanup | `/project:cleanup-smoke-test 25` | Automatic feedback merge, safe cleanup |
| Manual PR creation | Automatic (APPROVED path) | Streamlined workflow, consistent metadata |

### Feature Parity

| Feature | Old System | New System | Status |
|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| Code review | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Enhanced with decision tree |
| Test execution | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Same functionality |
| GitHub integration | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | New: tracking issues, PR creation |
| Feedback handling | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | New: structured feedback documents |
| Parallel execution | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | New: run multiple agents simultaneously |
| Context isolation | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | New: no agent interference |

### Migration Steps

1. **Update workflows** to use new commands
2. **Train team** on new `/project:run-smoke-test` usage
3. **Update documentation** to reference new approach
4. **Remove old scripts** once team is comfortable
5. **Monitor cost savings** from reduced API usage

## Best Practices

### When to Use

- **Feature implementation reviews**: Comprehensive validation of new functionality
- **Bug fix verification**: Ensure fixes work and don't introduce regressions
- **Refactoring validation**: Confirm behavior preservation during code improvements
- **Security reviews**: Validate security considerations and vulnerability fixes
- **Performance optimization**: Verify improvements don't break functionality

### Workflow Tips

1. **Use descriptive issue titles**: Helps with PR generation
2. **Include acceptance criteria**: Guides review validation
3. **Link related issues**: Maintains project context
4. **Keep branches focused**: One feature/fix per review
5. **Address feedback promptly**: Faster iteration cycles

### Performance Optimization

- **Clean up regularly**: Don't let worktrees accumulate
- **Use test mode** for script validation: `--test` flag
- **Monitor disk space**: Worktrees duplicate repository content
- **Batch related changes**: Review multiple related issues together when appropriate

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- GitHub CLI must be authenticated with appropriate scopes
- Claude CLI uses your account credentials securely
- Project scope required for GitHub project integration

### Data Isolation
- Worktrees are isolated from main development
- Feedback files contain only review information
- No secrets or credentials stored in review artifacts

### Access Control
- Uses existing GitHub repository permissions
- Claude CLI respects your account access levels
- Review tracking issues follow repository visibility

## Scalability Benefits

### Parallel Agent Execution

**Single Repository Limitations**:
- Only one agent can work effectively at a time
- Context conflicts reduce agent effectiveness
- File conflicts cause confusion and errors
- Manual worktree management is complex

**Isolated Worktree Advantages**:
- Run unlimited parallel agents simultaneously
- Each agent maintains clean, isolated context
- No file conflicts or unexpected changes
- Simple commands handle all complexity

### Team Efficiency

For teams working on multiple issues simultaneously:
- **Before**: Sequential reviews, agent interference
- **After**: Parallel reviews, clean isolation
- **Result**: Dramatically faster throughput, better quality

## Conclusion

The Review Automation workflow enables true agent swarm capabilities by providing complete isolation between parallel Claude agent sessions. By leveraging git worktrees behind simple commands, teams can run multiple agents simultaneously without context confusion or file conflicts.
