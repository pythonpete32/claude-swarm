# TypeScript Migration Validation Report

This document captures all validation issues discovered during the design review of our TypeScript modules.

## üìã Summary

We validated 5 areas:
1. **Module Interface Reality** - Do modules connect properly?
2. **Missing Critical Pieces** - What did we overlook from bash scripts?
3. **Over-Engineering** - Where is there unnecessary complexity?
4. **Future Extensibility** - Does it support the `.claude/workflows/` pattern?
5. **Library Exports** - What needs to be public API?

## üö® Critical Issues Found

### ‚úÖ Fixed During Workflow Design

1. **Worktree Module Updates**
   - Added `repositoryPath` parameter to `createWorktree`
   - Added `branchName` parameter for explicit branch naming
   - Added `head` field to `WorktreeInfo` 
   - Enhanced `findWorktrees` with glob pattern support and sorting
   - Added `hasUnpushedCommits` to `validateWorktreeState`

2. **Claude Module Updates**
   - Enhanced `sendPromptToSession` documentation

3. **Review Workflow Updates**
   - Fixed auto-detection logic to handle both swarm worktrees and regular branches
   - Added fallback from swarm worktrees to current branch for synchronous work
   - Added protected branch validation to prevent reviewing from main/master
   - Added branch pattern validation with warnings for non-matching branches

4. **Temp File Location Fixes**
   - Fixed temp file storage to use `planning/temp/` instead of `.claude/`
   - `.claude/` reserved for core Claude Code configuration only
   - Work reports: `planning/temp/work-reports/123.md`
   - Review metadata: `planning/temp/review-metadata.json`
   - All temp files git-ignored and cleanable

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed During Validation

### 1. Unnecessary Function Abstractions - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- `analyzeChangedFiles()` - ‚ùå REMOVED: Claude analyzes git diffs directly via prompt
- `readWorkReport()` - ‚ùå REMOVED: Claude finds files directly via prompt instructions
- `sendPromptToSession()` - ‚úÖ KEPT: Already defined in core-claude.md (needed for tmux)

### 2. Function Signature Mismatches - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- `ensureClaudeContext()` - ‚úÖ FIXED: Simplified to `Promise<void>`, removed complex status
- `generateReviewPrompt()` - ‚úÖ FIXED: Updated interface to match workflow usage

### 3. Temp File Architecture - COMPLETED ‚úÖ  
- ‚úÖ FIXED: Proper temp directory structure using `planning/temp/`
- ‚úÖ FIXED: Removed `.claude/` usage for temporary files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Found in Consistency Scan

### 1. ensureClaudeContext Function Conflict - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Status**: Resolved - Removed duplicate definition

**Problem**: Different signatures in core-claude.md vs core-files.md
**Solution**: Removed from core-claude.md, kept only in core-files.md where it belongs (file operations)
**Result**: Single source of truth for context file management

### 2. GitBranchInfo Missing sourceBranch Field - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Status**: Resolved - Added missing field

**Problem**: work-on-task.md creates branchInfo with `sourceBranch` field not in GitBranchInfo interface
**Solution**: Added `sourceBranch?: string` to GitBranchInfo interface in core-git.md
**Result**: Workflows can now include source branch information

### 3. Missing Core Module Functions - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Status**: All critical functions added to core modules

**Fixed in cleanup-worktree workflow**:
- ‚úÖ `cleanupCurrentWorktree` - Added to core-worktree.md
- ‚úÖ `findAbandonedWorktrees` - Added to core-worktree.md  
- ‚úÖ `cleanupAbandonedWorktrees` - Added to core-worktree.md

### 4. generateWorkPrompt Type Signature Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Status**: Resolved - Workflow updated to use proper GitBranchInfo

**Problem**: work-on-task.md manually constructed branchInfo missing required fields (isDetached, hasUncommittedChanges, hasStagedChanges)
**Solution**: Updated workflow to use `getCurrentBranch(worktree.path)` to get complete GitBranchInfo object  
**Result**: Type-safe branchInfo parameter with all required fields

## üìä Final Status Summary

### ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE
- **6 Core Modules**: comprehensive function signatures with validated APIs
  - core-worktree, core-git, core-github, core-claude, core-tmux, core-files
- **4 Complete Workflows**: orchestrating core modules properly
  - work-on-task, review-task, setup-project, cleanup-worktree  
- **Function Integration**: critical signatures resolved and consistent
- **Temp File Architecture**: proper separation (planning/temp/ not .claude/)
- **Cleanup Architecture**: agents can clean up their own environments
- **Setup Architecture**: GitHub infrastructure orchestration via Octokit

### üéØ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
