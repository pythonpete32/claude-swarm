# TypeScript Migration Validation Report

This document captures all validation issues discovered during the design review of our TypeScript modules.

## üìã Summary

We validated 5 areas:
1. **Module Interface Reality** - Do modules connect properly?
2. **Missing Critical Pieces** - What did we overlook from bash scripts?
3. **Over-Engineering** - Where is there unnecessary complexity?
4. **Future Extensibility** - Does it support the `.claude/workflows/` pattern?
5. **Library Exports** - What needs to be public API?

## üö® Critical Issues Found

### ‚úÖ Fixed During Workflow Design

1. **Worktree Module Updates**
   - Added `repositoryPath` parameter to `createWorktree`
   - Added `branchName` parameter for explicit branch naming
   - Added `head` field to `WorktreeInfo` 
   - Enhanced `findWorktrees` with glob pattern support and sorting
   - Added `hasUnpushedCommits` to `validateWorktreeState`

2. **Claude Module Updates**
   - Enhanced `sendPromptToSession` documentation

3. **Review Workflow Updates**
   - Fixed auto-detection logic to handle both swarm worktrees and regular branches
   - Added fallback from swarm worktrees to current branch for synchronous work
   - Added protected branch validation to prevent reviewing from main/master
   - Added branch pattern validation with warnings for non-matching branches

4. **Temp File Location Fixes**
   - Fixed temp file storage to use `planning/temp/` instead of `.claude/`
   - `.claude/` reserved for core Claude Code configuration only
   - Work reports: `planning/temp/work-reports/123.md`
   - Review metadata: `planning/temp/review-metadata.json`
   - All temp files git-ignored and cleanable

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed During Validation

### 1. Unnecessary Function Abstractions - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- `analyzeChangedFiles()` - ‚ùå REMOVED: Claude analyzes git diffs directly via prompt
- `readWorkReport()` - ‚ùå REMOVED: Claude finds files directly via prompt instructions
- `sendPromptToSession()` - ‚úÖ KEPT: Already defined in core-claude.md (needed for tmux)

### 2. Function Signature Mismatches - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- `ensureClaudeContext()` - ‚úÖ FIXED: Simplified to `Promise<void>`, removed complex status
- `generateReviewPrompt()` - ‚úÖ FIXED: Updated interface to match workflow usage

### 3. Temp File Architecture - COMPLETED ‚úÖ  
- ‚úÖ FIXED: Proper temp directory structure using `planning/temp/`
- ‚úÖ FIXED: Removed `.claude/` usage for temporary files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues To Address

### 1. Minor Function Signature Issues
**Status**: Low priority, mostly resolved in workflows

#### generateWorkPrompt() Parameter Type  
- Workflow creates partial `branchInfo` object instead of using full `GitBranchInfo`
- Consider whether this is actually needed or if we can simplify

#### getCurrentBranch() Return Type
- Some workflow calls expect `string`, function returns `GitBranchInfo`  
- Need to decide on consistent return type

## üìä Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed (Architecture Solid)
- **Core Modules**: 6 modules with clean, focused APIs
- **Workflows**: 2 complete workflows (work-on-task, review-task)  
- **Function Integration**: Most signatures validated and working
- **Temp File Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns

### üîÑ In Progress  
- **Remaining Workflows**: setup-project, cleanup-review
- **Minor Type Issues**: 2 small signature adjustments needed

### üéØ Ready for Implementation
The architecture is solid and ready. The few remaining issues are minor refinements that won't block development.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Workflows** - setup-project, cleanup-review
2. **Fix Minor Type Issues** - 2 small signature adjustments
3. **Begin Implementation** - Core design is complete and validated

## Validation Status

‚úÖ **Architecture Complete**: Core design is solid and extensively validated  
‚úÖ **Function Integration**: APIs connect properly and workflows are coherent  
‚úÖ **Ready to Implement**: No blocking issues remain
