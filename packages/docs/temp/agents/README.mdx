# Agent Types

*Understanding the three core agent types in Claude Codex*

## Overview

Claude Codex operates with three specialized agent types, each optimized for different aspects of the software development lifecycle.

## The Three Agent Types

### 🧠 [Planning Agents](planning-agents.md)
**Role**: Architectural design and project coordination
- Break down complex projects into manageable issues
- Coordinate dependencies and work distribution
- Engage in design discussions and architectural planning

### 👨‍💻 [Coding Agents](coding-agents.md)  
**Role**: Implementation and development
- Transform GitHub issues into working code
- Focus on high-quality implementation within defined scope
- Operate in isolated worktree environments

### 🔍 [Review Agents](review-agents.md)
**Role**: Quality assurance and validation
- Perform thorough code review and quality checks
- Make binary pass/fail decisions with detailed feedback
- Coordinate between local review and GitHub PR processes

## Agent Characteristics

### Stateless Design
*Agents don't maintain context across sessions*

### Issue-Focused Work
*Each agent works on specific GitHub issues*

### Isolated Environments
*Agents operate in separate worktrees for clean separation*
