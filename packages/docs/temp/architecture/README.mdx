# Architecture

*Technical architecture and system design of Claude Codex*

## System Overview

Claude Codex implements a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration platform built on a clean 4-layer architecture with GitHub-native workflow coordination.

## Architecture Principles

### 4-Layer Design
- **Commands**: CLI and UI entry points
- **Workflows**: Orchestration of multi-agent operations  
- **Core**: Reusable building blocks
- **Shared**: Common utilities and infrastructure

### Agent-First Design
- Multi-agent coordination through GitHub primitives
- Stateless agent design for clean separation
- Local execution for privacy and performance

### GitHub-Native Integration
- Issues as work units
- Pull requests as delivery mechanisms
- Comments as communication channels
