# Development Workflow

*Complete end-to-end development process using Claude Codex*

## Overview

The development workflow demonstrates how Planning, Coding, and Review agents work together to implement features from GitHub issues to merged pull requests.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Issue Creation

#### 1.1 Initial Planning Session
- Launch Planning Agent in dedicated UI area
- Engage in architectural discussion
- Break down feature requirements
- Identify dependencies and constraints

#### 1.2 Issue Generation
- Collaboratively create GitHub issues
- Define acceptance criteria
- Set up labels and milestones
- Link related issues and dependencies

#### 1.3 Work Prioritization
- Order issues by dependency requirements
- Plan parallel development streams
- Allocate resources and timelines

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### 2.1 Work Instance Creation
- Select GitHub issue for implementation
- Launch Coding Agent with issue context
- Create isolated worktree environment
- Initialize tmux session for terminal access

#### 2.2 Development Process
- Agent analyzes issue requirements and project context
- Reviews CLAUDE.md file and project documentation
- Implements solution with appropriate testing
- Makes incremental commits with clear messages

#### 2.3 Progress Monitoring
- Monitor agent progress through terminal streaming
- Track commits and file changes
- Provide guidance or clarification as needed

### Phase 3: Review and Quality Assurance

#### 3.1 Local Review Cycle
- Trigger Review Agent on completed work
- Agent examines:
  - Original issue requirements
  - Commit history and code changes
  - Project style guides and standards
  - Test coverage and quality

#### 3.2 Review Decision
- **Pass**: Review Agent creates pull request to GitHub
- **Fail**: Agent merges feedback to worktree and provides improvement guidance

#### 3.3 GitHub Integration
- Automated PR creation with detailed description
- Link to original issue and related work
- Trigger any external review services or checks

### Phase 4: Integration and Cleanup

#### 4.1 External Review (Optional)
- Human code review through GitHub interface
- External automated review services
- Integration testing and quality checks

#### 4.2 Merge and Cleanup
- Merge approved pull request
- Automatic cleanup of work instances
- Update issue status and close completed work
- Archive worktree and session data

## Best Practices

### Parallel Development
*Managing multiple concurrent development streams*

### Human Intervention Points
*When and how to provide guidance to agents*

## Common Patterns

### Feature Development
*Standard feature implementation workflow*

### Bug Fixes
*Targeted bug resolution process*

### Refactoring
*Code improvement and architecture updates*

### Documentation Updates
*Maintaining project documentation*
