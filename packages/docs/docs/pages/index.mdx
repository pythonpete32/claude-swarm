# Claude Codex

*Local AI Agent Orchestration Platform for Software Development*

## What is Claude Codex?

Claude Codex is a revolutionary platform that transforms how developers work with AI. Instead of using AI as a coding assistant, Claude Codex enables you to **orchestrate teams of AI agents** to work on your software projects.

> **Key Insight**: We're building software for humans to manage AI development teams, not just another AI coding assistant.

## The Paradigm Shift

Traditional development has developers writing code line by line. Claude Codex transforms developers into **orchestrators** of AI agent teams‚Äîessentially functioning as CTOs of their own virtual development companies.

### From Code Writer to Team Leader

- **Before**: Manual coding, limited parallel work, human implementation bottleneck
- **After**: Agent orchestration, true parallel development, strategic focus

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Deploy specialized Planning, Coding, and Review agents
- **GitHub-Native Workflows**: All coordination happens through standard GitHub primitives
- **Local Agent Orchestration**: Full control and privacy on your local machine
- **Terminal Integration**: Real-time terminal streaming and interaction
- **Project Management**: Visual dashboard for managing multiple AI development teams

## Three Core Agent Types

1. **üß† Planning Agents**: Architectural design and project coordination
2. **üë®‚Äçüíª Coding Agents**: Implementation and development work  
3. **üîç Review Agents**: Quality assurance and validation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Claude Codex
npm install -g claude-codex

# Initialize a new project
claude-codex init my-project

# Start the web interface
claude-codex start
```

## Architecture Overview

Claude Codex operates on a **4-layer architecture**:
- **Commands**: CLI and UI entry points
- **Workflows**: Orchestration of multi-agent operations
- **Core**: Reusable building blocks (git, worktree, github, tmux, claude, files)
- **Shared**: Common utilities (types, errors, config, validation)

## Why Local Development?

- **Privacy**: Code never leaves your environment
- **Performance**: No network latency for agent operations
- **Control**: Full control over agent configurations
- **GitHub Integration**: Deep integration with GitHub workflow primitives
